# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is fundamental to the success of any software development project. It not only streamlines the development process but also facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a clear framework for code and resource management. For this project, where we are building a web platform to influence AI behavior through decision markets, the file organization must support extensive functionality, integrate complex technologies, and maintain high security and scalability. Thus, a thoughtfully planned file structure plays a vital role in achieving these goals.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

This project utilizes a robust tech stack, including Next.js 14 for front-end development, TypeScript for type-safe code, and Tailwind CSS for modern styling. The backend leverages Supabase for data management and Starknet blockchain for enhanced security and scalability. Advanced AI agents, like LangChain and Microsoft AutoGen, are integrated to support market-driven decision making. Each component of the tech stack influences the file structure, necessitating separation of concerns between frontend and backend, organized configuration for security, and scalability considerations.

## Root Directory Structure

The root directory contains the fundamental directories and files that provide the foundational setup for the project. This includes:

*   **frontend/**: Contains all files related to the client-side application.

*   **backend/**: Houses server-side code including logic for market operations and AI integrations.

*   **config/**: Includes configuration files for different environments, security settings, and deployment scripts.

*   **docs/**: Provides documentation files that guide developers and document the project structure, features, and API usage.

*   Important root-level files:

    *   **package.json**: Manages project dependencies.
    *   **README.md**: Offers an overview and setup instructions for developers.
    *   **.env**: Contains environment variables.
    *   **next.config.js**: Configuration for the Next.js application.

## Frontend File Structure

The frontend directory is structured to promote modularity and reusability:

*   **components/**: Contains reusable UI components, such as buttons and form elements. This enhances consistency across the application.
*   **pages/**: Follows the file-based routing convention of Next.js, housing all individual pages like the Market Dashboard and Market Details Page.
*   **styles/**: Tailwind CSS is utilized here along with any custom styles necessary for specific components or layouts.
*   **utils/**: Holds utility functions that may be reused across various components.
*   **public/**: Contains static assets, such as images and fonts.

This organization allows for easy extension and modification of UI components and styles as the project grows.

## Backend File Structure

Organizing the backend directory is essential for clear logic separation and scalability:

*   **controllers/**: Handles incoming requests and communicates with services and models for processing.
*   **models/**: Defines the data structures and database operations, leveraging Supabase for storage operations.
*   **routes/**: Manages different API endpoints and ensures secure interactions with the client-side application.
*   **services/**: Contains business logic and operations related to market functions, and AI model interactions.
*   **test/**: Holds testing scripts for ensuring the integrity and performance of the backend code.

This structure supports maintenance by clearly distinguishing between different layers of backend operations.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files are pivotal in setting up the right environment for development, testing, and production:

*   **.env**: Stores environment-specific variables such as database connection strings and API keys.
*   **supabase-config.js**: Contains configurations specific to Supabase, managing database connections and authentication.
*   **starknet-config.json**: Manages the blockchain integration specifics, ensuring secure and effective interactions with Starknet.

Such precise configurations help manage different deployment scenarios and maintain security standards throughout the development lifecycle.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Quality assurance and knowledge sharing are supported through:

*   **tests/**: This subdirectory in the backend and frontend sections contains unit tests, ensuring each component and function works as expected.
*   **docs/**: Houses comprehensive documentation that supports new developers and maintains a historical record of project specifications, API documentation, and user manuals.

Through well-organized documentation and testing files, the project aims to maintain high standards of software quality.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The defined file structure plays a critical role in the development, maintenance, and scalability of the platform, which aims to revolutionize AI decision-making through market mechanisms. By supporting modular development, ensuring security through configuration and testing, and promoting clear documentation standards, this organization goes beyond conventional setups. The integration of blockchain like Starknet and advanced AI components necessitates a highly considered structure, ensuring this project can efficiently scale and meet the needs of its user base.

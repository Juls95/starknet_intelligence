### Introduction

This application is a web-based platform designed to democratize AI decision-making through the use of decision markets. It seeks to empower users, specifically traders and data-driven investors, to influence AI agent behavior using market-based consensus mechanisms. Through the application, users can create and participate in markets related to AI decisions, partake in conditional outcome betting, and engage with value prediction markets. The primary goal is to provide a transparent and secure platform, leveraging advanced AI tools and the Starknet blockchain, to facilitate scalable and efficient decision-making processes.

### Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users can discover the platform via direct links or promotional content that leads them to the landing page. Upon arriving, they are prompted to either sign up or log in to access the full suite of features. The sign-up process requires basic credentials, such as an email address and password. Users can also leverage social media logins if available, to streamline the registration process. Once registered, they receive a confirmation email, allowing them to activate their account. Existing users simply enter their credentials on the login page. For those who lose their password, a password recovery option is provided, where users can initiate a reset through their email. The platform also provides a straightforward logout option accessible from any page.

### Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful login, users are directed to the Market Dashboard, which serves as the home page. The dashboard presents an array of active decision markets along with key statistics, offering users options to browse through or search for markets of interest. Major sections include a sidebar for easy navigation, a header with account settings and notifications, and tiles displaying market summaries. This central hub enables users to quickly access market details, create new markets, or enter existing ones.

### Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The Market Details Page is a critical component where users explore specific markets in depth. Upon selecting a market from the dashboard, users are transported to this page, revealing detailed data including market conditions, historical information, real-time price movements, and participant predictions. Users can delve into the prediction aspects, placing bets on potential outcomes using the interface provided. If they wish to create a new market, they can return to the Dashboard and navigate to the market creation option, filling out necessary details regarding AI-driven choices.

In the AI Agent Console, users can configure actions for AI agents linked to market outcomes. This section allows the customization of AI behavior based on market feedback and tracks historical actions and performance metrics. To move back to the market information, users have a breadcrumb navigation path aiding in swift transition between the console and other sections like Market Details.

### Settings and Account Management

The User Profile page allows users to manage their personal information and review their participation history. Here, users can update account settings, adjust notification preferences, and review their betting history. Performance metrics are displayed, providing insights on successful and failed bets. If the platform offers subscription plans or advanced features, users can manage billing settings from this page, with options to change plans or update payment details. After account configurations, users can return to the previous task using easily accessible navigation links or return to the dashboard.

### Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the user experience, the platform includes robust error handling to maintain user engagement in the face of issues. If users input incorrect data during sign-up or login, the application offers immediate feedback with specific error messages guiding them to resolve the issue. In cases of connectivity loss or when attempting restricted actions, informational banners appear, suggesting corrective measures or alternatives. Users can return to the main flow effortlessly once the errors are resolved through automatic retries or prompts to take specified actions.

### Conclusion and Overall App Journey

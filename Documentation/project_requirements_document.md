# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The project at hand is a web platform tailored to empower users in influencing AI behavior via market-based consensus mechanisms. By allowing users to create and participate in decision markets, this platform democratizes AI decision-making, enabling a more distributed approach to navigating strategic AI agent actions. Users get to indulge in market creation for AI-led strategic decisions, betting on conditional outcomes, and engaging with value prediction markets. This should foster a community of traders and data-driven investors who can leverage sophisticated AI tools and newly established market rules to drive AI agentsâ€™ actions transparently.

Built to address the biases inherent in solo AI decision-making, this project seeks to introduce a collaborative decision-making layer. With the implementation of Starknet blockchain technology, the platform promises enhanced scalability and security, crucial for handling significant transaction volumes. The key success determinants are seamless user participation, accuracy in outcome prediction, and the reliable operation of AI-driven market-result integrations.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   Market creation for AI agent decisions, allowing users to set and participate in conditional outcome betting and value prediction markets.
*   Transparent integration between decision markets and AI actions, linked directly to the outcomes in these markets.
*   Automated resolution processes to ensure fair and efficient market settlements.
*   User interfaces including a Market Dashboard, Market Details Page, AI Agent Console, and User Profile with underlying functionalities.
*   Use of advanced AI tools (LangChain, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI, Claude Functions or OpenAI Swarms) for decision execution and performance tracking.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Deployment of features that offer personalized agent recommendations.
*   Extensions for deep AI insights and community-driven augmentation features.
*   Integration of additional cryptocurrencies or payment systems outside Starknet's capabilities.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user arrives on the AI-Driven Decision Markets Platform, they begin by signing up or logging into their account. The landing page is the Market Dashboard, where users can view a selection of active decision markets. After browsing or searching for a market of interest, they can dive deeper into specifics on the Market Details Page. Here, users can engage with the available data, make informed betting decisions on conditional outcomes, and track live pricing and predictions.

Once the user has engaged with a market, they can keep track of their activities and assess their decision impact through their User Profile. This section of the platform provides a comprehensive view of their betting history and performance metrics. To enhance their strategic decisions, users can also access the AI Agent Console, where they configure AI agent actions based on market influences, review historical actions, and evaluate the efficiency of agents tied to the decision-making process.
